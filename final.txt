I decide to run my GA program with a population size of 200 in 20 generations. For my parameters, I set the top 10% of each generation to be the parents of the next generation. I arrange them to mate randomly, so there's a possibilty that one mates with itself. My mutation rate was 33%, and it only mutates the new offspring, leaving the parents genes to be uncahnged.

Through 20 generations, my final average fitness was 92%, with the best being 96%. The first generation had an average fitness of only 6%, but its best fitness was 36%. So from those parents, each generation average fitness increased, and it only took to the fifth generation for the average fitness to be at least 90% (92%). So the average fitness increased quite fast for my program.
